h-full and w-full
h-full means height is 100% of the container (tailwind's h-full === normal css's 100%)
h-1/2 means height is half of the container's height(if container height=500px this means h-1/2 means height of current box is:250px)
For h-full to work:
👉 The parent must have a defined height
Otherwise, “100% of nothing = nothing”, and the element collapses.


h-screen = height: 100vh
w-screen = width: 100vw   (used in You’re building full-page layouts, Hero sections etc.)
Which means:
✔ vh and vw are based on the viewport
100vh = full browser window height
100vw = full browser window width

| Utility / Unit            | Depends on Parent? | Depends on Viewport? | Example Meaning                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `h-full` / `w-full`       | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No                 | “Take 100% of whatever size your parent has.” |
| `h-screen` / `w-screen`   | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                | “Take full screen height or width.”           |
| `h-[100vh]` / `w-[100vw]` | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                | Exact viewport height/width                   |


Many HTML elements come with default margin, padding, and sometimes borders.

difference between index.css and App.css:
| File          | Imported In | Scope            | Purpose                                 |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **index.css** | main.jsx    | Entire App       | Global resets + fonts + Tailwind layers |
| **App.css**   | App.jsx     | Single component | Component styling (non-global)          |

Do we even need App.css?
If you're using Tailwind, often the answer is:
👉 No. You may not need App.css at all.
